Connect directly to your Tesla Wall Connector to monitor energy usage and charger state. This app works with Tesla Wall Connector Gen 3 and Universal Wall Connector.

The TWC cannot be controlled. Power Sharing only provides access to the main TWC; data from the slaves are not accessible.

The app uses automatic mDNS discovery. When adding a new device, Homey automatically scans your network for compatible Wall Connectors. To ensure permanent connectivity, it is highly recommended to set a static IP or DHCP reservation for your Wall Connector in your router settings.
